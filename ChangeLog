hdapsd 20250908:
  Thomas Weißschuh:
  * log to syslog under systemd
  * do not overwrite existing activated systemd units

  Petter Reinholdtsen:
  * Added Appstream metadata XML with hardware mapping

  Evgeni Golov:
  * catch daemon() errors
  * don't pass argv to usage, it doesn't take any params
  * don't save oldz, we never read it back
  * fix compilation on modern systems with TIME_BITS=64
  * don't truncate reason when initializing

hdapsd 20141203:
	Evgeni Golov <evgeni@golov.de>:
	* Fix cleanup of generated .service files for systemd

	Whoopie <whoopie79@gmx.net>:
	* Use sigaction(2) instead of signal(2) for handling SIGUSR1
	  and SIGTERM. This helps stoping hdapsd properly when using
	  the DELL freefall sensor.

hdapsd 20141024:
	Brice Arnould <brice.arnould@gmail.com>:
	* Support for the HP3D sensor from Hewlett-Packard laptops.

	Evgeni Golov <evgeni@golov.de>:
	* Support for Apple MacBooks and MacBooks Pro with Intel CPUs.
	* Support for the generic FREEFALL sensor.
	* Support for Toshiba laptops (using both ACPI and HAPS).
	* Support for the generic input/joystick sensor.
	* Config file support using libconfig.

	Tomasz Torcz <tomek@pipebreaker.pl> and
	Thomas Weißschuh <thomas@t-8ch.de>:
	* systemd support

	Whoopie <whoopie79@gmx.net>:
	* Support for the DELL freefall sensor (smo8800)

hdapsd 20090401:
	Evgeni Golov <evgeni@golov.de>:
	* Support for the Apple Motion Sensor.
	* Udev rules obsolete, we can find the device on our own now.
	* Support autodetection of drives.
	* Try to autoload the needed modules, when neither HDAPS nor AMS
	  is found at startup.
	* Option to forcely enable UNLOAD on disks where the kernel thinks
	  it's unsupported.

hdapsd 20090129:
	Evgeni Golov <evgeni@golov.de>:
	* Support for multiple disks.
	* Support for logging to syslog when running in background.
	* Use autotools.
	* Make the error-messages more user-friendly.
	* -s is optional now. Sensitivity defaults to 15.

hdapsd 20081004:
	Elias Oltmanns <eo@nebensachen.de>:
	* Prepare for the new interface in kernel 2.6.28

hdapsd 20070803:
	Shem Multinymous <multinymous@gmail.com>:
	* Read the accelerometer data from the input device provided by
	  tp_smapi>=0.32, instead of sysfs. This reduce timer interrupts
	  and improves temporal synchronization of user-space<->kernel vs.
	  kernel<->hardware. If the input device doesn't exist, it falls
	  back to sysfs.
	* Add a new new --poll-sysfs (-y) parameter to force using sysfs
	  instead of the input device.
	* Read the sampling rate from the sysfs file provided by tp_smapi
	  (if it exists).
	* Add a --dry-run (-t) parameter, telling hdapsd to do everything
	  except actually parking the drive. Very useful for testing.
